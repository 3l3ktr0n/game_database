(1, 'test', '20', '1,13,20', '', '[html]<p>There&#039;s no easing into making a competitive game in 2020. Already inundated with games like Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, the battle royales, the MOBAs, and the auto chesses, players have plenty of choices, so if you want to present an alternative, it had better be ready for prime time. <a href=&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/bleeding-edge/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-497654&quot;>Bleeding Edge</a>, the new third-person competitive brawler from DmC developer Ninja Theory, doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s there yet. There&#039;s plenty of potential: Its four-on-four scrums blend the mashy feeling of an old school beat-em-up with the tactical considerations of MOBAs and hero shooters, setting it apart from anything you&#039;re going to find in popular competitive scenes. However, it suffers from &quot;early days&quot; growing pains that may push players away, rather than draw them in.</p>\r\n<p>Bleeding Edge is a self-described competitive multiplayer &quot;brawler,&quot; but what does that actually mean? Depending on your point of reference, you could call it a &quot;boots on the ground-style MOBA&quot; or a &quot;third-person hero shooter.&quot; It&#039;s an action game where two teams of four fight within the narrative framework of competing in one of two team sports--a King of the Hill-style &quot;Objective Control&quot; scenario and &quot;Power Collection,&quot; a resource-hoarding mode where players need to break energy canisters and return their contents to designated points at specific times. Though the two variants have their quirks, both boil down to dynamic point control. Whether you&#039;re delivering energy or protecting your &quot;hills,&quot; you need to defend a position. If you&#039;re trying to block your enemy from scoring in either mode, you need to take a position.</p>\r\n<div data-embed-type=&quot;video&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;2300-6452556&quot; data-src=&quot;/videos/lets-play-bleeding-edge/2300-6452556/&quot; data-width=&quot;100%&quot; data-height=&quot;100%&quot; data-video-start=&quot;0&quot;><iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/videos/embed/6452556/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;></iframe></div>\r\n<p>Both of these things require all four players to work as a team. Though some fighters are better suited for one-on-one combat than others, moving and fighting as a squad is mandatory because the team with larger numbers almost always wins, regardless of skill. Inevitably, each match becomes a series of teamfights for control of an area. In the moment, these battles can feel a bit mashy and sloppy as you rapidly jam on the attack button, but there&#039;s a good deal of strategy involved around creating favorable matchups, combining skills to maximize damage dealt and minimize damage taken, and positioning yourself to avoid wide-reaching crowd control attacks. On top of that, all of the levels present some kind of environmental hazard around one or more of the key points on the map, which can throw a wrench in the gears of the most pivotal moments in a match.</p>\r\n<p>The caveat, though, is that everyone needs to &quot;play their class&quot; as expected. With only four people to a team, having even one person who isn&#039;t paying attention to the objective or using their skills to help the team can drain the fun out of the game very quickly. This turns matchmaking into a bit of a crapshoot. You never know whether you&#039;re going to get teammates who know the score, or will drop everything to start fights, or play the objective too hard and ignore the team. Despite a warning when you turn on the game for the first time that communication is important, only a handful of players used headsets in my experience. While there is an Apex Legends-style ping system that works pretty well for silent players, many players don&#039;t pay attention to it. Even with solid communication options, the rigid demands of the gameplay make it easy for a single uncooperative person to spoil the match for the rest.</p>\r\n<p>When you get eight situationally aware players, though, there&#039;s a lot to love. The characters-- their design and balance--are the best part of Bleeding Edge. From the conventionally cool graffiti-artist street samurai Daemon to Maeve, the cyberpunk witch, to Cass, an emo assassin with robotic bird legs, each of the 11 characters in the initial roster has a distinctive and interesting look.</p>\r\n<p>More importantly, they also have a set of abilities that makes them especially well-suited to their specific kind of play. In modern competitive fashion, each character has a unique set of stats and rechargeable special moves that make them useful in a specific context, which really only presents itself when coordinating with your teammates. The characters are broken up into three classes--Damage, Support, Tank--but each character&#039;s approach to the role is unique. For example, Buttercup--a human-motorcycle hybrid--is a Tank made for crowd control: She forces enemies to engage with her by dragging enemies to her with a grappling hook and use an &quot;oil slick&quot; ability to slow them down. By contrast, fellow Tank El Bastardo is slightly less durable but deals more damage thanks to a very powerful standard attack and a crowd-clearing spin attack that will push enemies away from him. It takes a little practice to fully understand those distinctions well enough to take advantage of them, but it&#039;s easy to see how each fighter works.</p>\r\n<figure data-align=&quot;center&quot;

(2, 'qwerty', '13', '13', '', '[html]<p>There&#039;s no easing into making a competitive game in 2020. Already inundated with games like Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, the battle royales, the MOBAs, and the auto chesses, players have plenty of choices, so if you want to present an alternative, it had better be ready for prime time. <a href=&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/bleeding-edge/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-497654&quot;>Bleeding Edge</a>, the new third-person competitive brawler from DmC developer Ninja Theory, doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s there yet. There&#039;s plenty of potential: Its four-on-four scrums blend the mashy feeling of an old school beat-em-up with the tactical considerations of MOBAs and hero shooters, setting it apart from anything you&#039;re going to find in popular competitive scenes. However, it suffers from &quot;early days&quot; growing pains that may push players away, rather than draw them in.</p>\r\n<p>Bleeding Edge is a self-described competitive multiplayer &quot;brawler,&quot; but what does that actually mean? Depending on your point of reference, you could call it a &quot;boots on the ground-style MOBA&quot; or a &quot;third-person hero shooter.&quot; It&#039;s an action game where two teams of four fight within the narrative framework of competing in one of two team sports--a King of the Hill-style &quot;Objective Control&quot; scenario and &quot;Power Collection,&quot; a resource-hoarding mode where players need to break energy canisters and return their contents to designated points at specific times. Though the two variants have their quirks, both boil down to dynamic point control. Whether you&#039;re delivering energy or protecting your &quot;hills,&quot; you need to defend a position. If you&#039;re trying to block your enemy from scoring in either mode, you need to take a position.</p>\r\n<div data-embed-type=&quot;video&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;2300-6452556&quot; data-src=&quot;/videos/lets-play-bleeding-edge/2300-6452556/&quot; data-width=&quot;100%&quot; data-height=&quot;100%&quot; data-video-start=&quot;0&quot;><iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/videos/embed/6452556/&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;></iframe></div>\r\n<p>Both of these things require all four players to work as a team. Though some fighters are better suited for one-on-one combat than others, moving and fighting as a squad is mandatory because the team with larger numbers almost always wins, regardless of skill. Inevitably, each match becomes a series of teamfights for control of an area. In the moment, these battles can feel a bit mashy and sloppy as you rapidly jam on the attack button, but there&#039;s a good deal of strategy involved around creating favorable matchups, combining skills to maximize damage dealt and minimize damage taken, and positioning yourself to avoid wide-reaching crowd control attacks. On top of that, all of the levels present some kind of environmental hazard around one or more of the key points on the map, which can throw a wrench in the gears of the most pivotal moments in a match.</p>\r\n<p>The caveat, though, is that everyone needs to &quot;play their class&quot; as expected. With only four people to a team, having even one person who isn&#039;t paying attention to the objective or using their skills to help the team can drain the fun out of the game very quickly. This turns matchmaking into a bit of a crapshoot. You never know whether you&#039;re going to get teammates who know the score, or will drop everything to start fights, or play the objective too hard and ignore the team. Despite a warning when you turn on the game for the first time that communication is important, only a handful of players used headsets in my experience. While there is an Apex Legends-style ping system that works pretty well for silent players, many players don&#039;t pay attention to it. Even with solid communication options, the rigid demands of the gameplay make it easy for a single uncooperative person to spoil the match for the rest.</p>\r\n<p>When you get eight situationally aware players, though, there&#039;s a lot to love. The characters-- their design and balance--are the best part of Bleeding Edge. From the conventionally cool graffiti-artist street samurai Daemon to Maeve, the cyberpunk witch, to Cass, an emo assassin with robotic bird legs, each of the 11 characters in the initial roster has a distinctive and interesting look.</p>\r\n<p>More importantly, they also have a set of abilities that makes them especially well-suited to their specific kind of play. In modern competitive fashion, each character has a unique set of stats and rechargeable special moves that make them useful in a specific context, which really only presents itself when coordinating with your teammates. The characters are broken up into three classes--Damage, Support, Tank--but each character&#039;s approach to the role is unique. For example, Buttercup--a human-motorcycle hybrid--is a Tank made for crowd control: She forces enemies to engage with her by dragging enemies to her with a grappling hook and use an &quot;oil slick&quot; ability to slow them down. By contrast, fellow Tank El Bastardo is slightly less durable but deals more damage thanks to a very powerful standard attack and a crowd-clearing spin attack that will push enemies away from him. It takes a little practice to fully understand those distinctions well enough to take advantage of them, but it&#039;s easy to see how each fighter works.</p>\r\n<figure data-align=&quot;center&quot;

It\r\n has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making \r\nit over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at \r\nHampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure \r\nLatin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through \r\nthe cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the \r\nundoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 \r\nof "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by \r\nCicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of \r\nethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem \r\nIpsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section \r\n1.10.32.</p><p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is\r\n reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 \r\nfrom "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in \r\ntheir exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914\r\n translation by H.
